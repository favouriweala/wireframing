**Introduction to Wireframing**
**What is Wireframing?**

Wireframing is the process of creating a basic visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a digital product â€” such as a website or application. It focuses on layout, structure, and functionality rather than colors, images, or typography. Wireframes help designers, developers, and stakeholders visualize how users will interact with the interface before moving on to detailed design or development.

**Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process**

Wireframing plays a crucial role in the design process for several reasons:

Clarity and Structure: It helps define the content layout and hierarchy, ensuring that every element has a purpose and place.

Early Validation: Wireframes allow teams to test ideas and get feedback early, reducing costly changes later in development.

Improved Collaboration: Designers, developers, and stakeholders can align on functionality and flow before visual details are added.

User-Centered Design: By focusing on usability and navigation first, wireframes ensure the final design enhances user experience.
